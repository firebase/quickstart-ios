# Google Analytics for Firebase Quickstart

This Firebase quickstart is written in Swift and showcases how Firebase
Analytics can provide insight on app usage and user engagement. You can read more
about Google Analytics for Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics)!

The iOS, iPadOS, and Catalyst versions are powered by UIKit. The tvOS and macOS
versions are powered by SwiftUI.

## Getting Started

Google Analytics for Firebase offers multiple ways to understand how users are
engaging with your app. In this quickstart, we demonstrate how you can use
Google Analytics for Firebase to log in-app events and set user properties.

Ready? Let's get started! ðŸš€

Clone this project and `cd` into the `AnalyticsExample` directory.
Run `pod install`. This command will install all of the required cocoapods
for this quickstart and generate a `.xcworkspace` project. Go ahead and
open the `AnalyticsExample.xcworkspace` project.

### Terminal commands to clone and open the project!
```terminal

git clone https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios.git

cd analytics/

pod install --repo-update

open AnalyticsExample.xcworkspace
```

## Connecting to the Firebase Console

We will need to connect our quickstart with the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). For an in
depth explanation, you can read more about
[adding Firebase to your iOS Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).

### Here's a summary of the steps!
1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
and create a new app.

2. Add an iOS app to the project. Make sure the `Bundle Identifier` you
set for this iOS App matches that of the one in this quickstart. This should be the
same for all platforms.

3. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` when prompted.

4. Drag the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` into the opened
quickstart app. In Xcode, you can also add this file to the project by going
to `File` â†’ `Add Files to 'AnalyticsExample'` and selecting the
downloaded `.plist` file. Be sure to add the `.plist` file to all targets.

5. At this point, you can build and run the quickstart! ðŸŽ‰

> When running the quickstart on macOS or macCatalyst, a prompt may be
> presented that requests keychain access. This occurs because these platforms
> do not use a sandboxed keychain and instead use the primary keychain. To
> dismiss the prompt, enter the requested password and select `Always allow`.
> Note: this prompt can be avoided entirely by signing your application.

## Interacting with the Quickstart

Google Analytics for Firebase is a great way to
[log user related events](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/events?platform=ios)
or [set user properties](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/user-properties?platform=ios).
This quickstart features a number of different UI controls that a user can interact with.
Depending on the control, Google Analytics for Firebase is used to either set a
user property or log an appropriate event.

## Viewing the analytics data

### Debug Logging
Sometimes it is helpful to view debug logging when working with
Google Analytics for Firebase. This can easily be enabled in Xcode by
specifying `-FIRAnalyticsDebugEnabled` as a [runtime argument](http://goo.gl/RfcP7r).
Using Xcode's menu bar, navigate to `Product` â†’ `Scheme` â†’ `Edit Scheme...`.
Using the vertical menu on the left, select the **Run** scheme.
Then click **Arguments** and add  `-FIRAnalyticsDebugEnabled` as an
argument passed on launch. Done! âœ“

### Firebase Console [DebugView](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/debugview)

As you interact with the controls in the quickstart, analytics data will be sent to the
Firebase Console. To view and interact with this stream, navigate to the project you
set up for this quickstart on the Firebase Console. Select **DebugView** under the
**Analytics** on the vertical menu on the left. From here, you can interact with the
quickstart and see the related analytics data show up live on the Firebase Console.
