Firebase Crashlytics Quickstart
===============================

The Firebase Crashlytics iOS quickstart demonstrates how to report crashes and log events leading up
to those crashes. You can read more about Firebase Crashlytics
[here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/)! 

To view the older Objective-C and Swift quickstarts, view the
[`LegacyCrashlyticsQuickstart`](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios/tree/master/crashlytics/LegacyCrashlyticsQuickstart)
directory.

Getting Started
---------------

### Clone and open Crashlytics quickstart project

- Clone the quickstart repo and `cd` into the `crashlytics` directory.
- Open file `CrashlyticsExample.xcodeproj` project using Xcode.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios.git
$ cd crashlytics/
$ open CrashlyticsExample.xcodeproj
```
- Once the `.xcodeproj` is opened, update to the latest Swift Package Versions: go to the menu bar,
  click on File > Swift Packages > Update to Latest Package Versions. 

### Connecting to the Firebase Console 
- To have a functional application, you will need to connect the Crashlytics quickstart example with
  the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
- For an in-depth explanation, you can read more about [adding Firebase to your iOS
  Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup). Below is a summary of the main steps:
  1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) 
  2. Add an iOS app to the project. Make sure the `Bundle Identifier` you set for this iOS App
     matches that of the one in this quickstart.
  3. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` when prompted.
  4. Drag the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist` into the opened quickstart app under the
     `Shared` folder.
- Now you should be able to build and run the Firebase project!

### Trigger a crash in Crashlytics quickstart app
1. Click `Build and then run the current scheme` in Xcode to build your app on a device or
   simulator.
2. Click `Stop running the scheme or action` in Xcode to close the initial instance of your app.
   This initial instance includes a debugger that interferes with Crashlytics.
3. Open your app again from the simulator or device.
4. Touch `Crash` button to crash the app.
5. Open your app once more to let the Crashlytics API report the crash. Your crash should show up in
   the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) within 5 minutes.

implementation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/test-implementation?hl=hu&platform=ios)
