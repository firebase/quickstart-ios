Firebase Performance Monitoring Quickstart
=============================

# Firebase Performance Monitoring

Firebase Performance Monitoring is a free mobile app performance analytics service. It
provides detailed information about the performance of your apps (app start, network requests, screen performance) automatically,
while also allowing you to measure the performance of any piece of code in your apps.

Introduction
------------
The app is centered around image tasks: download, classify, saliency map, and upload. Downloading
and uploading images is a common developer task. Classifying the image and generating a saliency map
are tasks that might be more popular now with the success of computer vision algorithms. Classifying
the image consists of providing categories to which the image belongs. A saliency map identifies the
parts of an image most likely to draw attention.

Network requests are automatically traced by Performance Monitoring, while custom traces are used to
measure the classification task.

The typical usage flow consists of downloading the image, classifying the image, generating the
saliency map, and lastly uploading the saliency map. The status of the task (idle, running, success,
failure) is displayed for the userâ€™s convenience.

Getting Started
---------------

- [Add Firebase to your iOS / tvOS Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).
- [Create a default Cloud Storage bucket](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/ios/start#create-default-bucket).
- [Replace your Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security/get-started#access_your_rules) with the following:
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /saliency_map.jpg {
      allow create: if request.resource.contentType == 'image/jpeg'
    }
  }
}
```
- Run the sample on your iOS / tvOS device or simulator.
